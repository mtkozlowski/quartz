- 16    On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:     “Fear not, O Zion;         let not your hands grow weak. 17    The LORD your God is in your midst,         a mighty one who will save;     he will rejoice over you with gladness;         he will quiet you by his love;     he will exult over you with loud singing.

- 34Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. [10] 35Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? 36As it is written,     “For your sake we are being killed all the day long;         we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” 37No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, 39nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
