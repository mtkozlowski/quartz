- For the rich, young ruler, the one thing was a choice. “Do I trust in my riches or do I trust in Jesus?” There was no room for both. Before he could ever go to Heaven, he had to decide where his confidence would lie. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DNK6EZY&location=101))
