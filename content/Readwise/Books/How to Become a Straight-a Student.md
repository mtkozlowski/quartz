## Highlights
- “to keep my mind stimulated, I regularly rotate between different venues.” ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=740))
- Even when you feel like you are on a roll, keep taking regular breaks. Over the long run, it will maximize your energy and retention of the material. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=762))
- Why does this timing work the best? I don’t know exactly. Some cognitive science research concludes that about fifty minutes is the optimal learning period to maximize the material synthesized per time unit. For example, the Web site for the IPFW Center for Academic Support and Advancement states: “Studies suggest you should study in 40 or 50 minute increments for maximum retention. After approximately 40 minutes, take a short break (5 minutes) and continue studying. Without a break, retention is about 30% after 2 hours.”1* ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=764))
- The key to doing well in these courses is straightforward: Identify the big ideas. That’s what it all comes down to. Exams in nontechnical courses focus entirely on big ideas—they require you to explain them, contrast them, and reevaluate them in the light of new evidence. If you are aware of, and understand, all of the big ideas presented in the course, these tasks are not so difficult, and strong grades will follow.

- Professors ramble. And they rarely start a class by clearly identifying the big ideas that will be explored. Instead, they tend to dive right in, leaving the poor student to separate on his own the interesting conclusions from the digressions. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=907))
- If you’re writing down an exception to the last observation you recorded, start with: “HOWEVER:…” ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=925))
- You should take advantage of this reality by recording all your notes in a Question/Evidence/Conclusion format. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=941))
- “It’s important to read over your notes right after class to absorb them and make corrections and additions, otherwise you’ll be susceptible to entirely forgetting what was covered that day.” These little moments and adjustments will make a big difference when it comes time to review. ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=969))
- Clearly label the topic of the discussion. If a student makes a point that strikes you as insightful, jot it down. If you think up a point that strikes you as insightful, first jot it down, then raise your hand and offer it to the class. Participation keeps you focused. If a student says something you feel is mistaken or irrelevant, just ignore it. And, most important, if the professor chimes in, write down what he says and underline it several times. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=1025))
- So how do you decide which supplemental readings to review, which to skim, and which to skip? Straight-A students follow this simple hierarchy:           Readings that make an argument are more important than           readings that describe an event or person, which are more important than           readings that only provide context (i.e., speech transcripts, press clippings). ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=1124))
- the most effective way to imprint a concept is to first review it and then try to explain it, unaided, in your own words. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=1355))
- (1) Brute force study habits are incredibly inefficient; and (2) It is possible to come up with techniques that work much better and require much less time. ([Location 2628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000MAHBYQ&location=2628))
