## Highlights
- The writer Jonathan Lethem has said that when people call something “original,” nine out of ten times they just don’t know the references or the original sources involved. ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=53))
- right there in the Bible: “There is nothing new under the sun.” (Ecclesiastes 1:9) ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=57))
- As the French writer André Gide put it, “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=58))
- If we’re free from the burden of trying to be completely original, we can stop trying to make something out of nothing, and we can embrace influence instead of running away from it. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=60))
- Just as you have a familial genealogy, you also have a genealogy of ideas. You don’t get to pick your family, but you can pick your teachers and you can pick your friends and you can pick the music you listen to and you can pick ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=74))
- You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences. The German writer Goethe said, “We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.” ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=77))
- “We were kids without fathers . . . so we found our fathers on wax and on the streets and in history. We got to pick and choose the ancestors who would inspire the world we were going to make for ourselves.” —Jay-Z ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=79))
- The artist is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there’s a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love. ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=84))
- There’s an economic theory out there that if you take the incomes of your five closest friends and average them, the resulting number will be pretty close to your own income. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=85))
- Instead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=98))
- Seeing yourself as part of a creative lineage will help you feel less alone as you start making your own stuff. I hang pictures of my favorite artists in my studio. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=102))
- Google everything. I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don’t ask a question before you Google it. You’ll either find the answer or you’ll come up with a better question. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=112))
- to whatever lengths necessary to make sure you always have paper on you. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=123))
- Artist David Hockney had all the inside pockets of his suit jackets tailored to fit a sketchbook. The musician Arthur Russell liked to wear shirts with two front pockets so he could fill them with scraps of score sheets. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=124))
- Keep a swipe file. It’s just what it sounds like—a file to keep track of the stuff you’ve swiped from others. It can be digital or analog—it doesn’t matter what form it takes, as long as it works. You can keep a scrapbook and cut and paste things into it, or you can just take pictures of things with your camera phone. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=126))
- “It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.” —Mark Twain ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=132))
- If I’d waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started “being creative,” well, I’d still be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=137))
- In my experience, it’s in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=139))
- Fake it ’til you make it. I love this phrase. There are two ways to read it: 1. Pretend to be something you’re not until you are—fake it until you’re successful, until everybody sees you the way you want them to; or 2. Pretend to be making something until you actually make something. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=151))
- I love both readings—you have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have, and you have to start doing the work you want to be doing. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=155))
- All the world’s a stage. Creative work is a kind of theater. The stage is your studio, your desk, or your workstation. The costume is your outfit—your painting pants, your business suit, or that funny hat that helps you think. The props are your materials, your tools, and your medium. The script is just plain old time. An hour here, or an hour there—just time measured out for things to happen. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=165))
- “Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy you will find your self.” —Yohji Yamamoto ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=170))
- We don’t come out of the womb knowing who we are. In the beginning, we learn by pretending to be our heroes. We learn by copying. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=173))
- We’re talking about practice here, not plagiarism—plagiarism is trying to pass someone else’s work off as your own. Copying is about reverse-engineering. It’s like a mechanic taking apart a car to see how it works. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=174))
- “I emulated Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis. We all did.” McCartney and his partner John Lennon became one of the greatest songwriting teams in history, but as McCartney recalls, they only started writing their own songs “as a way to avoid other bands being able to play our set.” As Salvador Dalí said, “Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.” ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=180))
- You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=189))
- The reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds. That’s ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=190))
- “We want you to take from us. We want you, at first, to steal from us, because you can’t steal. You will take what we give you and you will put it in your own voice and that’s how you will find your voice. And that’s how you begin. And then one day someone will steal from you.” —Francis Ford Coppola ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=195))
- So: Copy your heroes. Examine where you fall short. What’s in there that makes you different? That’s what you should amplify and transform into your own work. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=210))
- In the end, merely imitating your heroes is not flattering them. Transforming their work into something of your own is how you flatter them. Adding something to the world that only you can add. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=212))
- The best advice is not to write what you know, it’s to write what you like. Write the kind of story you like best—write the story you want to read. The same principle applies to your life and your career: Whenever you’re at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, “What would make a better story?” ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=235))
- When we love a piece of work, we’re desperate for more. We crave sequels. Why not channel that desire into something productive? ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=241))
- Think about your favorite work and your creative heroes. What did they miss? What didn’t they make? What could’ve been made better? If they were still alive, what would they be making today? If all your favorite makers got together and collaborated, what would they make with you leading the crew? ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=243))
- manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=247))
- The computer is really good for editing your ideas, and it’s really good for getting your ideas ready for publishing out into the world, but it’s not really good for generating ideas. There are too many opportunities to hit the delete key. The computer brings out the uptight perfectionist in us—we start editing ideas before we have them. The cartoonist Tom Gauld says he stays away from the computer until he’s done most of the thinking for his strips, because once the computer is involved, “things are on an inevitable path to being finished. Whereas in my sketchbook the possibilities are endless.” ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=281))
- “The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.” —Jessica Hische ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=302))
- think it’s good to have a lot of projects going at once so you can bounce between them. When you get sick of one project, move over to another, and when you’re sick of that one, move back to the project you left. Practice productive procrastination. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=308))
- Take time to be bored. One time I heard a coworker say, “When I get busy, I get stupid.” Ain’t that the truth. Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=311))
- If you’re out of ideas, wash the dishes. Take a really long walk. Stare at a spot on the wall for as long as you can. As the artist Maira Kalman says, “Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind.” Take time to mess around. Get lost. Wander. You never know where it’s going to lead you. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=314))
- If you have two or three real passions, don’t feel like you have to pick and choose between them. Don’t discard. Keep all your passions in your life. This is something I learned from the playwright Steven Tomlinson. “You can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.” —Steve Jobs ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=318))
- Tomlinson suggests that if you love different things, you just keep spending time with them. “Let them talk to each other. Something will begin to happen.” ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=324))
- It’s so important to have a hobby. A hobby is something creative that’s just for you. You don’t try to make money or get famous off it, you just do it because it makes you happy. A hobby is something that gives but doesn’t take. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=334))
- Don’t throw any of yourself away. Don’t worry about a grand scheme or unified vision for your work. Don’t worry about unity—what unifies your work is the fact that you made it. One day, you’ll look back and it will all make sense. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=337))
- Step 1: Wonder at something. Step 2: Invite others to wonder with you. You should wonder at the things nobody else is wondering about. If everybody’s wondering about apples, go wonder about oranges. The more open you are about sharing your passions, the closer people will feel to your work. Artists aren’t magicians. There’s no penalty for revealing your secrets. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=364))
- You don’t put yourself online only because you have something to say—you can put yourself online to find something to say. The ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=374))
- “Distance and difference are the secret tonic of creativity. When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything.” —Jonah Lehrer ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=421))
- It helps to live around interesting people, and not necessarily people who do what you do. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=437))
- The food should be good. You have to find a place that feeds you—creatively, socially, spiritually, and literally. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=439))
- There’s only one reason I’m here: I’m here to make friends. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=446))
- “There’s only one rule I know of: You’ve got to be kind.” —Kurt Vonnegut ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=450))
- “The only mofos in my circle are people that I can learn from.” —Questlove ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=453))
- If you ever find that you’re the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=462))
- “Quit picking fights on Twitter and go make something!” She was right. But anger is one of my favorite creative resources. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=466))
- “Complain about the way other people make software by making software.” —Andre Torrez ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=471))
- So, I recommend public fan letters. The Internet is really good for this. Write a blog post about someone’s work that you admire and link to their site. Make something and dedicate it to your hero. Answer a question they’ve asked, solve a problem for them, or improve on their work and share it online. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=480))
- The important thing is that you show your appreciation without expecting anything in return, and that you get new work out of the appreciation. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=483))
- Not everybody will get it. People will misinterpret you and what you do. They might even call you names. So get comfortable with being misunderstood, disparaged, or ignored—the trick is to be too busy doing your work to care. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=493))
- I put every really nice e-mail I get in a special folder. (Nasty e-mails get deleted immediately.) When those dark days roll around and I need a boost, I open that folder and read through a couple e-mails. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=502))
- “Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.” —Gustave Flaubert ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=507))
- The thing is: It takes a lot of energy to be creative. You don’t have that energy if you waste it on other stuff. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=513))
- Neil Young sang, “It’s better to burn out than to fade away.” I say it’s better to burn slow and see your grandkids. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=516))
- Writing a page each day doesn’t seem like much, but do it for 365 days and you have enough to fill a novel. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=547))
- The comedian Jerry Seinfeld has a calendar method that helps him stick to his daily joke writing. He suggests that you get a wall calendar that shows you the whole year. Then, you break your work into daily chunks. Each day, when you’re finished with your work, make a big fat X in the day’s box. Every day, instead of just getting work done, your goal is to just fill a box. “After a few days you’ll have a chain,” Seinfeld says. “Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.” ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=549))
- What project you worked on, where you went to lunch, what movie you saw. It’s much easier than keeping a detailed diary, and you’d be amazed at how helpful having a daily record like this can be, especially over several years. The small details will help you remember the big details. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=557))
- “If you ask yourself ‘What’s the best thing that happened today?’ it actually forces a certain kind of cheerful retrospection that pulls up from the recent past things to write about that you wouldn’t otherwise think about. If you ask yourself ‘What happened today?’ it’s very likely that you’re going to remember the worst thing, because you’ve had to deal with it—you’ve had to rush somewhere or somebody said something mean to you—that’s what you’re going to remember. But if you ask what the best thing is, it’s going to be some particular slant of light, or some wonderful expression somebody had, or some particularly delicious salad.” —Nicholson Baker ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=562))
- Who you marry is the most important decision you’ll ever make. And “marry well” doesn’t just mean your life partner—it also means who you do business with, who you befriend, who you choose to be around. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=573))
- this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so they can concentrate on what’s really important to them. Nothing is more paralyzing than the idea of limitless possibilities. The idea that you can do anything is absolutely terrifying. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=582))
- way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself. It seems contradictory, but when it comes to creative work, limitations mean freedom. Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts. Don’t make excuses for not working—make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now. ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=585))
- Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat with only 236 different words, so his editor bet him he couldn’t write a book with only 50 different words. Dr. Seuss came back and won the bet with Green Eggs and Ham, one of the bestselling children’s books of all time. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=589))
- “Telling yourself you have all the time in the world, all the money in the world, all the colors in the palette, anything you want—that just kills creativity.” —Jack White ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=592))
