## Highlights
- Horace’s well-known Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori (“Sweet and fitting it is to die for one’s country”; Odes 3.2.13) merely sums up what many had said and believed. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1255))
- Other psalms and other prophetic writings insist that the divine purpose is eventually to bring the whole world under the rescuing and rehumanizing rule of Israel’s God. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1721))
- promised new creation for which the promised land is a sign and symbol. ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1723))
- just as the Creator chose the covenant people to be the means of rescuing the human race, so now, with the chosen people themselves in need of rescue, God might do the same thing again. ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1736))
- That it would have to happen was the conviction born of the prophetic belief. ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1739))
- He would, despite all, be faithful to his covenant, to his purposes for creation itself. ([Location 1740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1740))
- These words all converge on the idea we sketched in the previous chapter: that humans were made for a purpose, that Israel was made for a purpose, and that humans and Israel alike have turned aside from that purpose, distorted the vision, and abused their vocation. ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1772))
- Humans were made to be “image-bearers,” to reflect the praises of creation back to the Creator and to reflect the Creator’s wise and loving stewardship into the world. ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1778))
- Humans are made to worship the God who created them in his own image and so to be sustained and renewed in that image-bearing capacity. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1782))
- “Worship” was and is a matter of gazing with delight, gratitude, and love at the creator God and expressing his praise in wise, articulate speech. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1786))
- Those who do this are formed by this activity to become the generous, humble stewards through whom God’s creative and sustaining love is let loose into the world. ([Location 1787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1787))
- In addition—and this is vital for grasping the meaning of Jesus’s crucifixion—they give to whatever idol they are worshipping the power and authority that they, the humans, were supposed to be exercising in the first place. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1791))
- The target is a wise, full human life of worship and stewardship. ([Location 1794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1794))
- Like fire, these “forces” are good servants but bad masters. Not ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1805))
- They stop being demons when they stop being gods. ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1808))
- we reduce the problem to “our wrong behavior” and try to explain the cross simply as the divine answer to that, we will never get to the heart of the matter. Nor, in fact, will we fully understand how the cross dealt with sin itself. ([Location 1819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1819))
- Again and again Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel insist on the point: exile has come about because of sin, the sin that fundamentally consists in and then grows out of idolatry. ([Location 1846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1846))
- Exile is therefore to be understood as a kind of corporate national death. Leaving the land is leaving the garden; leaving the ruined Temple means being debarred from the Tree of Life. ([Location 1848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1848))
- Once again we note that this is the passage in which we find, in chapters 52 and 53, the most striking of all biblical images about one person suffering and dying on behalf of the many. ([Location 1957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1957))
- The postexilic prophets—Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi—insisted that it would happen, but it hadn’t yet. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ARKFWSC&location=1968))
