## Highlights
- Create Urgency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8h21gtw4ayjgcqcczfh546))
- I often hear parents or other advocates urge teachers to accommodate students with ADHD by giving them a lengthy or indefinite amount of time to turn in assignments. This creates a situation where deadlines are unclear, yet most of the students with ADHD that I have worked with need a clear deadline to create the urgency and adrenaline necessary to complete the task.

    - Note: https://www.edutopia.org/blog/writing-strategies-students-with-adhd-tracy-collins says differently about time urgency
- **Provide deadlines:** I teach students time management skills by breaking projects into chunks, each with a detailed description, rubric, and due date. For example, a research paper might have a separate due date for a topic, completed research, outline, rough draft, and final paper. I grade each step in the process, and each grade contributes to the final grade. This teaches students how to break up large projects to ensure timely completion.

- **Time tasks:** Timing tasks that could be rote and boring—like learning math facts and letter sounds, increasing reading fluency, and memorizing vocabulary—turns what could potentially be a tedious task into a game or competition with oneself. Timing is used not to create anxiety but to increase performance over time—students are never graded on timed activities and don’t share their scores. Instead they’re challenged to beat the clock and to do better than they did last time. Graphing scores as a visual reminder of progress helps students learn about goal setting and develop a growth mindset. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8h5hpg2nrwqe54wzg8s4xr))

- **Engage students’ passions:** My students are more engaged when they see that I’m passionate about a subject. We all want to know why we should learn something. Providing a hook to each lesson in the form of a story, game, or question gets students excited to figure out a problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8h7n4k83efvcaym17b2jep))

- This activity helps students have a more concrete basis for understanding how to make an inference when they’re reading. It also usually leads to interesting discussions on how prior knowledge can greatly impact understanding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8h8vjefz391ahdb3wacjn5))

- **Use brain breaks:** Students will take breaks anyway, so making breaks a reward is an easy way to keep them on task. I try to help them increase their focus to 15 to 25 minutes of working time, and after periods of concentration, they receive a short break. During the break, students can stretch, sharpen their pencils, get supplies, talk quietly to a friend, or rest. This timing method, sometimes called the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), helps students increase focus over time.

- **Let students move:** I find that I get more out of students if I give them a chance to dance, stretch, or exercise before they have to sit down and work quietly. This can be led by the teacher, a short video, or a student. Usually it’s brief and structured, like a game of Simon Says or a set of 10 jumping jacks and a few standing toe touches.

- I believe all students thrive when they know what to expect. For students with ADHD, having an orderly environment is essential. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9mtzyngs709gn4w5rnfytn))
- **Have clear expectations:** Establishing a routine that stays the same even when activities change makes children feel secure. Rules can be taught through an activity with an example and non-example or by acting them out. This strategy is also useful for highlighting age-appropriate social skills like how to listen when someone is presenting or how to determine the appropriate amount of personal space.

- **Teach study skills explicitly:** Students know they can Google facts, but teaching them how to learn creates relevance. Regardless of what subject is being taught, it’s possible to incorporate study skills lessons—how to take notes, read a textbook, or study. Students will need these skills in the future when they’re required to learn on their own. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9mzp7gp5nfqgc97dbmkh66))
