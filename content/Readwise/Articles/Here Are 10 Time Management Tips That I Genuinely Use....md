## Highlights
- 1 - We own all of our time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pg5w0v6f2yy1xjabnj0j3))
- Instead of saying ‘I don’t have time’, say ‘I’m choosing to do this task now, and that task later’. It gives you back control over what you spend time on and can help you prioritise better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pdz2s79c2603q8wzg3r9a))
- 2 - Hell yeah or no ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pg331t6escpzsx76apm2c))
- The way to counter that is to make decisions by saying either ‘hell yeah’ or ‘hell no’. If it’s not a ‘hell yeah’ straight away, we should let it pass. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pem0tcnfdfwpnt8wt3nyz))
- 3 - The daily highlight ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pg02jqyr9thw3kbdhqe03))
- The idea is that each day, we choose one specific task that we want to get done, simply saving us from an overly long to-do list and analysis paralysis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pfpgv60t2926z1yapd2wz))
- 4 - Use a to-do list ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pgsmvtxxpzxbrnbnn3y1e))
- Do yourself a favour and keep a daily checklist of tasks so you can stay on track. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pgrzeb075v6pfwnfx6173))
- 5 - Time blocking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pgy2hpd8e6rkahqzmabt1))
- Whenever we have a task to do we should put a time block in our calendar just for this thing - it really is as simple as it sounds ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2ph7gdz46cby50ey0ebb9y))
- I like to use this technique in combination with the daily highlight to make sure the most important task is protected in my cal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2ph6k8kyh2mxez26waqh8a))
- 6 - Parkinson’s Law ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2phjhd7hwfd04x6fhkwzdn))
- To take advantage of Parkinson’s Law we need to leverage deadlines, even if they’re somewhat artificial. Putting pressure on when you need to get a task done by will help you tick it off. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2phna5w3x78bmasq207zm4))
- If you want to learn more about the laws of productivity, I have a Skillshare class on it here: [skillshare.com/site/join?teac…](https://www.skillshare.com/site/join?teacherRef=3785132&via=teacher-referral&utm_campaign=teacher-referral&utm_source=ShortUrl&utm_medium=teacher-referral&t=Productivity-Masterclass-The-Principles-of-Productivity&sku=647318269) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2phw4ew79yx1hwdzj6hkre))
- 7 - Protected time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pm5bcjae6q2f9j9pv8dk4))
- These days I set my protected time for the first 4 hours of my mornings and I use it to write my book. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pm9djdtpgj5r0thar6qaj))
- 8 - Delegation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pmdncwvqe7y0vqjfk7qmm))
- The way I got over that doubt was by setting a fixed hourly rate. A dollar value of my time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pmpj5zcd6ra3wn6ctxn2d))
- If something could be delegated for cheaper, I’d use services like Fiverr to hire freelancers who were more than happy to do things like data entry or video editing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pmxt1w501zzhkmc8b055r))
- 9 - Automated scheduling ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pn8h9kc881g2f8vt98vf8))
- 10 - The choice to be satisfied ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pns7scd4cmfb4cc2zr8gy))
- The last tip is more philosophical. For us productivity nerds, it’s easy to feel dissatisfied at the end of the day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2pp27nv7dp519ks9h1xmph))
- We can either stress out about the things we haven’t managed to do or choose to be satisfied with the work we’ve done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2ppaap60jrbysw9vpwm6ff))
- Choosing to be satisfied will likely have a more positive impact on our behaviour and performance the next day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq2ppcpm1z8fswbx4ta3491e))
