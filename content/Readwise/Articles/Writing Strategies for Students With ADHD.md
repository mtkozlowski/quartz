- Solution: Create small, manageable milestones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8gv9va0jq6nqzbg5558639))
- Since accomplishing a five-page essay takes a lot of time, you can chop it into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces that can be worked on in rotation. Each piece may be checked separately if time allows. Treating every issue and section as an independent task will prevent students from feeling overwhelmed as they work toward a larger goal.

- There are plenty of writing apps and tools available to check spelling and grammar. As a teacher, you can introduce several apps and let students choose which ones work better for writing essays. When checking the submitted papers and grading the work, highlight the spelling mistakes so that students can pay special attention to the misspelled words and remember the correct variant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq8gwsbvwk0weebzf0ew9ky0))
- Solution: Teach them to review their writing step by step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq9n2j3cse796n465b7vxexw))
- Take an essay template as an example and show students how to revise it. Go through the editing process slowly, explaining the "why" behind certain changes, especially when it comes to grammatical issues. Assign students the task of revising each other's essays so that when they revise their own final draft, they'll know what to pay attention to and what common mistakes to look for.
